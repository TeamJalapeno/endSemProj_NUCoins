      "Its masterful agility allows it to climb the toughest Himalayas with ease, its thick coat enables it to survive in the harsh environments of our north, its unmatchable strength and resilience gives it an edge over the animals that reside near it. Undoubtedly, the magnificence of the Markhor inspires to live and to strive rigorously, optimistically and relentlessly.",
      "At the Markhor wilderness based leadership program, we seek to create individuals who have the will in themselves to embody the qualities of our national animal. These include solving problems tactfully, confronting endless challenges, being energetic in doing so and marching forward no matter what. In the professional world, it is these qualities that bring success to our youth as individuals and collectively, as a country.",
      "This program stems from a desire to bring the high potential youth of Pakistan together and to inculcate the spirit of social leadership in them. At the Markhor Leadership Conference, 2016, there will be representatives from different regions around the country who will be given opportunities to put their leadership skills to the test by participating in different tasks which involve wilderness challenges, interacting with communities and also with nature."
