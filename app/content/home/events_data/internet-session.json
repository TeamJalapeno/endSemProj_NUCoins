    "NSS in collaboration with the Digital Rights Foundation umbrella brings you the ‘Hamara’ Internet project Online harassment is not a rare phenomenon in Pakistan, women are blackmailed with photo shopped pictures, have their accounts hacked & threatened online. Many women eventually end up restricting their online presence or limiting their online behavior. Nearly half of the reported cyber crimes are connected to the harassment of women on social media.",
    "Here at NSS, we believe in women empowerment and protecting women from online harassment, making them more than capable of facing situations like these themselves head-on.",
    "For this sole purpose the ‘Hamara’ Internet project is being introduced in NUST by NSS . Hamara Internet will sensitize our students to online threats along with measures they can take to stay safe online, without compromising on the time they spend online or limiting themselves while they use digital tools. Furthermore this program will help teach them real life skills that they can potentially use for many years to come. SO to all the women out there, do come to the sessions on the 18th of May. More power to all of you!"
